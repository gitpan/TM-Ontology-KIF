TM-Ontology-KIF
===============

This package provides a simplistic (but slow) parser for the KIF
(knowledge interchange format). I have no idea how complete this
implementation is as I am mainly interested in converting the KIF
version of SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) into TopicMaps.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

HOW TO USE

The TM::Ontology::KIF package only provides a parser for KIF (or a
subset of it). It will read a stream provided and will invoke a
subroutine whenever it has successfully parsed a KIF
sentence. Applications are supposed to provide this function.

In the bin directory there is a utility which converts a KIF stream into
an AsTMa= instance. Invoke it with

  kif2atm --help

for more information. The example directory contains a Makefile with
some suggested use.

CAVEATS

Please read the man page of TM::Ontology::KIF.

TODO

Support all of KIF. Something for long winter evenings. And more speed.
